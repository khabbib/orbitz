The Moon is drifting away from Earth... :(
We think that the Moon was made when a Mars sized object SMASHED into Earth!
The Moon's surface is dark.
Earth and the Moon are the same age. How cute.
The Moon's gravity pulls on Earth's oceans.
The Moon always has the same side turned towards Earth, because Earth's rotation slowed it down.
The Moon is actually NOT round! It's shaped like an egg!
The Moon has no seasons!
The Moon's surface is like powder and called "regolith".
The Moon takes about 27 days to go around the earth.
