The Earth-like planets we have discovered are almost as big as Jupiter.
70% of Earth's surface is water.
The atmosphere is about 10,000 kilometers wide.
The Earth core is molten iron and creates a magnetic field.
The magnetic field,the magnetosphere, channels the solar wind around the Earth, protecting us from harm.
It actually takes 23 hours, 56 minutes and 4 seconds for the Earth to rotate once completely on its axis.
A year on Earth is not 365 days. It is actually 365.2564 days and why we have leap years every fourth year.
Earth has THE moon, but also two other moons called 3753 Cruithne and 2002 AA29, and are asteroids!
1977 we sent to probes: Voyager 1 and 2 into interstellar space with records of our planet for aliens!
On 25 August 2012, Voyager 1 had become the first man-made object to enter interstellar space.
