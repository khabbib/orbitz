Neptune has 14 known moons, which are named for minor water deities in Greek mythology.
The largest moon is Triton, discovered by William Lassell on October 10, 1846, 17 days after the discovery of Neptune itself.
Neptune's outermost moon Neso, which has an orbital period of about 26 Julian years, orbits further from its planet than any other moon in the Solar System.

Triton is unique among moons of planetary mass in that its orbit is retrograde to Neptune's rotation and inclined relative to Neptune's equator, which suggests that it did not form in orbit around Neptune but was instead gravitationally captured by it.
Triton is massive enough to have achieved hydrostatic equilibrium and to retain a thin atmosphere capable of forming clouds and hazes.

Inward of Triton are seven small regular satellites, all of which have prograde orbits in planes that lie close to Neptune's equatorial plane; some of these orbit among Neptune's rings.
Psamathe and Neso, have the largest orbits of any natural satellites discovered in the Solar System to date.
