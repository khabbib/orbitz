The moons of Saturn are numerous and diverse, ranging from tiny moonlets only tens of meters across to enormous Titan, which is larger than the planet Mercury.
Saturn has 82 moons with confirmed orbits that are not embedded in its rings– of which only 13 have diameters greater than 50 kilometers – as well as dense rings that contain millions of embedded moonlets and innumerable smaller ring particles.
Particularly notable among Saturn's moons are Titan, the second-largest moon in the Solar System (after Jupiter's Ganymede), with a nitrogen-rich Earth-like atmosphere and a landscape featuring dry river networks and hydrocarbon lakes.
The moon Enceladus emits jets of gas and dust from its south-polar region.
The regular satellites are traditionally named after Titans and Titanesses or other figures associated with the mythological Saturn.
