Uranus, the seventh planet of the Solar System, has 27 known moons, most of which are named after characters that appear in, or are mentioned in, the works of William Shakespeare and Alexander Pope.
Uranus's moons are divided into three groups: thirteen inner moons, five major moons, and nine irregular moons.
The inner moons are small dark bodies that share common properties and origins with Uranus's rings.
The five major moons are ellipsoidal, indicating that they reached hydrostatic equilibrium at some point in their past.
The largest moon, Titania, is 1,578 km in diameter and the eighth-largest moon in the Solar System, about one-twentieth the mass of the Earth's Moon.
Uranus's irregular moons have elliptical and strongly inclined orbits at large distances from the planet.
The five major moons have planetary mass, and so would be considered dwarf planets if they were in direct orbit about the Sun.
The smaller moons were discovered after 1985, either during the Voyager 2 flyby mission or with the aid of advanced Earth-based telescopes.
