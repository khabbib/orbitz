The origin of Mars's moons is unknown and the hypotheses are controversial. The main hypotheses are that they formed either by capture or by accretion.

Deimos is the smaller and outermost of the two natural satellites of the planet Mars, the other being Phobos.

Deimos has a mean radius of 6.2 km (3.9 mi) and takes 30.3 hours to orbit Mars.
Deimos is 23,460 km (14,580 mi) from Mars, much further than Mars's other moon, Phobos.
It is named for Deimos who in Greek mythology is the twin brother of Phobos, and personifies terror.

Deimos has been photographed in close-up by several spacecraft whose primary mission has been to photograph Mars.
No landings on Deimos have been made.

The Soviet Phobos program sent two probes to Phobos. Both probes launched successfully in July 1988.

Phobos is a small, irregularly shaped object with a mean radius of 11 km (7 mi) and is seven times as massive as the outer moon, Deimos.
Phobos is named after the Greek god Phobos, a son of Ares (Mars) and Aphrodite (Venus) and the personification of fear.

Phobos orbits 6,000 km (3,700 mi) from the Martian surface, closer to its primary body than any other known planetary moon.
